You need type any character on "Authorize" box, to set the Authorization key on header, and finally, you can test the routes.

## üßÅ Final considerations

It was a pleasure to carry out this test. I tried to use some techniques and concepts in order to demonstrate part of my knowledge.

*The fake authorization was just to exemplify what the control would be like. In the authorization phase, it would be possible to validate with JWT, for example.
